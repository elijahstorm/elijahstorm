ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Elijah Storm. Check out my [portfolio](https://elijahstorm.github.io/) :)

I specialize in Front End Web and Mobile development. Also I have a wide range of skills and interests involving tech and Ai. Currently I'm employed as a software developer for a company working with patients and medical data. In 2021, I taught students Python and JavaScript, part time, in South Korea. I developed a lesson plan to teach Flutter to students in South Korea, and gave it to the company WuCoding to use pro-bono.
